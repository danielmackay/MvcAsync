MvcAsync
========

MvcAsync is a project that investigates the myriad of ways that you can load data into an HTML page.  This includes both synchronous and asynchronous techniques.

Goals
-----
* **Minimal Requests:** This means that the data will always come down with the inital page load. This could the data could either be HTML or JSON.  In the case of JSON it is embedded in the page and then used to construct the HTML on the client.
* **Logic-less Views:** This means that any calculations are done in C# and store in ViewModels.  These ViewModels are then bound to the views (server-side) to produce the initial HTML.
